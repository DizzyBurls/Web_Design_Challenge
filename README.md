# Description:

	In this project I have written scripts which, to my knowledge, satisfy every section of the task. 
	See screen captures 1 - 12 which I have uploaded to this repository. They show main features that we were required to create.
    The website can be found at https://dizzyburls.github.io/Web_Design_Challenge/index.html.

    I opted to take advantage of the offers laid out in the BONUS section guidelines.
    I did choose to use my own data source from Homework Task 6.
    I also chose to tinker with the color scheme of my website.
    I added extra links on certain pages to enhance manoeuvrability across the site.
    The site is fully function on a small screen. I tested it on my iPhone 11.

# Activation of work:

    (1) Locate the HTML file called index.html and run it in Chrome. 
 
	(2) Navigate through the site using the navigation bar or the links on each page.
